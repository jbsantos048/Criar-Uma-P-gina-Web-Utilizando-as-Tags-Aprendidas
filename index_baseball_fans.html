            <b>Baseball</b> has been around for a very long time, it’s America’s 
            past time sport. <b>Baseball</b> began around the mid-1800s by a man named 
            <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a></i> in Cooperstown New York. The first official 
            game of baseball took place in 1846 in Hoboken New Jersey but the very first 
            professional baseball team that was established was in Cincinnati, 
            they were called the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Red_Stockings">Red Stockings</a></i>. The picture above shows <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth">Babe Ruth</a></i> 
            swinging a bat, Babe Ruth started out as a pitcher for the <i><a href="#">Boston Red Sox</a></i> 
            but he became well known for his batting. The home run leaders every year 
            were only able to hit about an average of 15 home runs a year before Babe 
            Ruth hit 29 home runs in a season in 1919. After that year Babe Ruth became
            a massive slugger hitting 30+ home runs almost every season. He became a 
            member of the <i><a href="https://baseballhall.org/">baseball hall of fame</a></i> in the year 1936, 95.13% of people 
            voted for him because of the enormous amount of power he had. After Babe 
            Ruth showed off his power to the world, more and more players began to show 
            that Babe Ruth’s power can be matched, players like <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron">Hank Aaron</a></i> could hit 30+ 
            home runs every season. There was also a time where steroids were used very 
            often, called the steroid era. This era took place in the late 1900s to the 
            early 2000s. Well known players like <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds">Barry Bonds</a></i> did indeed take steroids during 
            this era, <u><mark>players had ridiculous stats during this era</mark></u>. <b>Baseball</b> has changed a 
            lot since when it first started, the equipment, the rules, and today we use 
            technology to capture any missed calls or just for replaying a moment during 
            the game.

        <h2 id="rules">THE OFFICIAL BASEBALL RULES</h2>
        <p>Form The Official Playing Rules Committee:</p>
        <i><q>
            Baseball not only has maintained its position as the National Game of the
United States, but also has become an International Game being played in
more than 100 countries. The popularity of the game will grow only so long
as its players, managers, coaches, umpires and administrative officers respect
the discipline of its code of rules.
        </q></i>
        <h3>1 - OBJECTIVES OF THE GAME</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Baseball is a game between two teams of nine players each, under
                direction of a manager, played on an enclosed field in accordance
                with these rules, under jurisdiction of one or more umpires.</li>
            <li>The offensive team’s objective is to have its batter become a runner,
                and its runners advance.</li> 
            <li>The defensive team’s objective is to prevent offensive players from
                becoming runners, and to prevent their advance around the bases.</li>
            <li>When a batter becomes a runner and touches all bases legally he
                shall score one run for his team.</li>
            <li>The objective of each team is to win by scoring more runs than the
                opponent.</li>
            <li>The winner of the game shall be that team which shall have scored,
                in accordance with these rules, the greater number of runs at the
                conclusion of a regulation game.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>2 - THE PLAYING FIELD</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><i style="color: green;">Layout of the Field:</i>The infield shall be a 90-foot square. The outfield shall be the area
                between two foul lines formed by extending two sides of the square.The distance from home
                base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on fair territory
                shall be 250 feet or more. A distance of 320 feet or more along
                the foul lines, and 400 feet or more to center field is preferable.The infield shall be graded so that the base lines and home plate
                are level. The pitcher’s plate shall be 10 inches above the level of
                home plate. The degree of slope from a point 6 inches in front of the
                pitcher’s plate to a point 6 feet toward home plate shall be 1 inch to
                1 foot, and such degree of slope shall be uniform. The infield and
                outfield, including the boundary lines, are fair territory and all other
                area is foul territory.It is desirable that the line from home base through the pitcher’s
                plate to second base shall run East-Northeast.
                It is recommended that the distance from home base to the backstop,
                and from the base lines to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction
                on foul territory shall be 60 feet or more. See Appendix 1.
                When location of home base is determined, with a steel tape
                measure 127 feet, 33
                ⁄8 inches in desired direction to establish second
                base. From home base, measure 90 feet toward first base; from
                second base, measure 90 feet toward first base; the intersection
                of these lines establishes first base. From home base, measure 90
                feet toward third base; from second base, measure 90 feet toward
                third base; the intersection of these lines establishes third base. The
                distance between first base and third base is 127 feet, 33
                ⁄8 inches. All
                measurements from home base shall be taken from the point where
                the first and third base lines intersect.</li>
            <li><i style="color: green;">Home Base:</i>Home base shall be marked by a five-sided slab of whitened rubber.
                It shall be a 17-inch square with two of the corners removed so that
                one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are 8½ inches and
                the remaining two sides are 12 inches and set at an angle to make a
                point. It shall be set in the ground with the point at the intersection
                of the lines extending from home base to first base and to third base;
                with the 17-inch edge facing the pitcher’s plate, and the two 12-inch
                edges coinciding with the first and third base lines. The top edges of
                home base shall be beveled and the base shall be fixed in the ground
                level with the ground surface. </li>
            <li><i style="color: green;">The Bases:</i>First, second and third bases shall be marked by white canvas or
                rubber-covered bags, securely attached to the ground as indicated in
                Diagram 2. The first and third base bags shall be entirely within the
                infield. The second base bag shall be centered on second base. The
                bags shall be 15 inches square, not less than three nor more than five
                inches thick, and filled with soft material.</li>
            <li><i style="color: green;">The Pitcher’s Plate:</i>The pitcher’s plate shall be a rectangular slab of whitened rubber,
                    24 inches by 6 inches. It shall be set in the ground as shown in
                    Diagrams 1 and 2, so that the distance between the pitcher’s plate
                    and home base (the rear point of home plate) shall be 60 feet, 6
                    inches.</li>
            <li><i style="color: green;">Benches:</i>The home Club shall furnish players’ benches, one each for the
                home and visiting teams. Such benches shall not be less than
                twenty-five feet from the base lines. They shall be roofed and shall
                be enclosed at the back and ends.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3 - EQUIPMENT AND UNIFORMS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><i style="color: brown;">The Ball:</i>The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small
                core of cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two strips of
                white horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh
                not less than five nor more than 5¼ ounces avoirdupois and measure
                not less than nine nor more than 9¼ inches in circumference.
                No player shall intentionally discolor or damage the ball by
                rubbing it with soil, rosin, paraffin, licorice, sand-paper, emerypaper or other foreign substance.
                PENALTY: The umpire shall demand the ball and remove
                the offender from the game. In addition, the offender shall be
                suspended automatically for 10 games. For rules in regard to
                a pitcher defacing the ball, see Rules 6.02(c)(2) through (6).
                <b><font style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 115%;">Rule 3.01 Comment</font>:</b> Should a ball come partially apart in a
                game, it is in play until the play is completed.</li>
            <li>
                <i style="color: brown;">The Bat:</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) The bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches
                        in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in
                        length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood. <b><i>NOTE:</i></b> No laminated or experimental bats shall be used in a
                        professional game (either championship season or exhibition
                        games) until the manufacturer has secured approval from the
                        Rules Committee of his design and methods of manufacture.</li>
                    <li>(b) Cupped Bats. An indentation in the end of the bat up to 1¼
                        inches in depth is permitted and may be no wider than two
                        inches and no less than one inch in diameter. The indentation
                        must be curved with no foreign substance added.</li>
                    <li>(c) The bat handle, for not more than 18 inches from its end, may
                        be covered or treated with any material or substance to improve
                        the grip. Any such material or substance that extends past the
                        18-inch limitation shall cause the bat to be removed from the
                        game. <b><i>NOTE:</i></b> If the umpire discovers that the bat does not
                        conform to (c) above until a time during or after which
                        the bat has been used in play, it shall not be grounds for
                        declaring the batter out, or ejected from the game. <b><font style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 115%;">Rule 3.02(c) Comment</font>:</b>If pine tar extends past the 18-inch
                        limitation, then the umpire, on his own initiative or if alerted
                        by the opposing team, shall order the batter to use a different
                        bat. The batter may use the bat later in the game only if the
                        excess substance is removed. If no objections are raised prior
                        to a bat’s use, then a violation of Rule 3.02(c) on that play does
                        not nullify any action or play on the field.</li>
                    <li>(d) No colored bat may be used in a professional game unless
                        approved by the Rules Committee.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                thumb crotch. The web shall measure not more than seven inches
                across the top or more than six inches from its top to the base of the
                thumb crotch. The web may be either a lacing, lacing through leather
                tunnels, or a center piece of leather which may be an extension of the
                palm, connected to the mitt with lacing and constructed so that it will
                not exceed any of the above mentioned measurements.</li>
            <li><i style="color: brown;">First Baseman’s Glove:</i>The first baseman may wear a leather glove or mitt not more than
                thirteen inches long from top to bottom and not more than eight
                inches wide across the palm, measured from the base of the thumb
                crotch to the outer edge of the mitt. The space between the thumb
                section and the finger section of the mitt shall not exceed four inches
                at the top of the mitt and three and one-half inches at the base of
                the thumb crotch. The mitt shall be constructed so that this space is permanently fixed and cannot be enlarged, extended, widened, or
                deepened by the use of any materials or process whatsoever. The
                web of the mitt shall measure not more than five inches from its top
                to the base of the thumb crotch. The web may be either a lacing,

                may be an extension of the palm connected to the mitt with lacing
                and constructed so that it will not exceed the above mentioned
                measurements. The webbing shall not be constructed of wound or
                wrapped lacing or deepened to make a net type of trap. The glove
                may be of any weight.</li>
            <li><i style="color: brown;">Fielding Gloves:</i>Each fielder, other than the catcher, may use or wear a leather
                glove. The measurements covering size of glove shall be made by
                measuring front side or ball receiving side of glove. The tool or
                measuring tape shall be placed to contact the surface or feature of
                item being measured and follow all contours in the process. The
                glove shall not measure more than 13 inches from the tip of any
                one of the 4 fingers, through the ball pocket to the bottom edge or
                heel of glove. The glove shall not measure more than 7 ¾ inches
                wide, measured from the inside seam at base of first finger, along
                base of other fingers, to the outside edge of little finger edge of
                glove. The space or area between the thumb and first finger, called
                crotch, may be filled with leather webbing or back stop. The
                webbing may be constructed of two plies of standard leather to
                close the crotch area entirely, or it may be constructed of a series of
                tunnels made of leather, or a series of panels of leather, or of lacing
                leather thongs. The webbing may not be constructed of wound or
                wrapped lacing to make a net type of trap. When webbing is made
                to cover entire crotch area, the webbing can be constructed so as to

                joined together. These sections may not be so constructed to allow
                depression to be developed by curvatures in the section sides. The
                webbing shall be made to control the size of the crotch opening. The
                crotch opening shall measure not more than 4 ½ inches at the top,
                not more than 5 ¾ inches deep, and shall be 3 ½ inches wide at its
                bottom. The opening of the crotch shall not be more than 4 ½ inches
                at any point below its top. The webbing shall be secured at each
                Rule 3.05 to 3.06 side, and at top and bottom of crotch. The attachment is to be made
                with leather lacing, these connections to be secured. If they stretch
                or become loose, they shall be adjusted to their proper condition.
                The glove can be of any weight. See Appendix 4 for diagram of

                        manner. No fielder, regardless of position, may use a fielding
                        glove that falls within a PANTONE® color set lighter than the
                        current 14-series.</li>
                    <li>(b) No pitcher shall attach to his glove any foreign material of a
                        color different from the glove.</li>
                    <li>(c) The umpire-in-chief shall cause a glove that violates Rules

                        initiative, at the recommendation of another umpire or upon
                        complaint of the opposing manager that the umpire-in-chief

                        See Rule 5.11(a). As a courtesy, potential substitute players
                        should also be listed, but the failure to list a potential substitute

                                pitchers for a game.</li>
                            <li>(2) From September 1 through the end of the championship

                                Clubs may designate a maximum of 14 pitchers for a

                            <li>(3) Players who qualify as “Two-Way Players” under Major
                                League Rule 2(b)(2) may appear as pitchers during a game

                                as Two-Way players or pitchers by the Club may appear
                                in a championship season or postseason game as a
                                pitcher, except that any player may appear as a pitcher
                                following the 9th inning of an extra inning game, or in
                                any game in which his team is losing or winning by equal
                                to or more than 6 runs when the player enters as a pitcher;
                                provided, however, that any player added to the Active
                                List as a 27th Player prior to September 1 shall not count
                                toward the maximum of 13 pitchers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        copies of the respective batting orders are identical, and then
                        tender a copy of each batting order to the opposing manager.
                        The copy retained by the umpire shall be the official batting 
                        order. The tender of the batting order by the umpire shall
                        establish the batting orders. Thereafter, no substitutions shall be
                        made by either manager, except as provided in the rules.</li>  
                    <li>(e) As soon as the home team’s batting order is handed to the
                        umpire-in-chief the umpires are in charge of the playing field
                        and from that moment the umpire-in-chief shall have sole
                        authority to determine when a game shall be called, suspended
                        or resumed on account of weather or the condition of the playing
                        field. The umpire-in-chief shall not call the game until at least
                        30 minutes after he has suspended play. The umpire-in-chief
                        may continue the suspension so long as he believes there is any
                        chance to resume play. Nothing in this Rule is intended to
                        affect a Club’s ability to suspend or resume any game pursuant
                        to a policy governing severe weather, significant weather threats,
                        and lightning safety that has been filed with the league office
                        prior to the championship season.</li>

                    are noticed by the umpire-in-chief before he calls “Play” for
                    the start of the game, should be called to the attention of the
                    manager or captain of the team in error, so the correction can
                    be made before the game starts. For example, if a manager
                    has inadvertently listed only eight men in the batting order,
                    or has listed two players with the same last name but without
                    an identifying initial and the errors are noticed by the umpire
                    before he calls “play,” he shall cause such error or errors to be
                    corrected before he calls “play” to start the game. Teams should
                    not be “trapped” later by some mistake that obviously was
                    inadvertent and which can be corrected before the game starts.
                    The umpire-in-chief shall at all times try to complete a
                    game. His authority to resume play following one or more
                    suspensions of as much as 30 minutes each shall be absolute
                    and he shall terminate a game only when there appears to be no
                    possibility of completing it.
                    The Major Leagues have determined that Rule 4.03(e) does not
